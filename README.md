# Year-11-CS-Unit-6-Classes-Tutorial-ZombiePlant

Your job is to create one class called ZombiePlant. 
You should pass all of the tests in the ZombiePlantTester class (provided).

This question involves the implementation of a zombie plant treatment system that is represented by the ZombiePlant class. A ZombiePlant object is created with parameters that specify the maximum potency for a successful treatment and the initial number of successful treatments required to cure the plant.
The ZombiePlant class provides a constructor and the following methods.

* treatmentsNeeded, which returns the number of successful treatments required to cure the plant.
* isDangerous, which returns true if the plant requires treatment, false otherwise.
* treat, which administers a treatment with the specified potency.
